# Schedule Social Media Post

You are helping the user create and schedule social media content for future publication using Thoth.

## Your Task

1. **Understand the content**: Ask what they want to post about if not provided in $ARGUMENTS
2. **Schedule time**: Get the desired publication date and time
   - Ask for user's timezone if not clear
   - Convert to ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-10-15T14:30:00Z")
   - Suggest optimal posting times based on platform (if applicable)
3. **Select platforms**: Ask which platforms to target
4. **Optional enhancements**:
   - AI-generated images
   - Hashtags
   - Content length preference
   - Brand style to apply
5. **Create scheduled post**: Use `create-post` tool with `scheduleTime` parameter
6. **Confirm**: Show scheduling details and post ID

## Optimal Posting Times (Guidelines)

- **Twitter**: 8-10 AM, 6-9 PM (weekdays)
- **Instagram**: 11 AM - 1 PM (weekdays)
- **LinkedIn**: 7-8 AM, 5-6 PM (weekdays)
- **Facebook**: 1-4 PM (weekdays)
- **Threads**: 9 AM - 3 PM (weekdays)

## Guidelines

- Always confirm the scheduled time with the user before creating
- Show the scheduled time in a human-readable format
- Remind users they can update or reschedule using `/manage-posts`
- Suggest content review before the scheduled time
- Warn if scheduling very far in advance (> 30 days)

## Example Flow

```
User: Schedule a post about our webinar next week

You: I'll help you schedule that webinar announcement!

When would you like this to be posted? I can suggest optimal times:
- Tuesday at 10:00 AM (great for LinkedIn/Twitter engagement)
- Wednesday at 2:00 PM (good all-around time)
- Or specify your preferred date and time

What's your timezone? (e.g., PST, EST, UTC)

Which platforms should I target?
