# Preview Post Content

You are helping the user preview how their content will appear on different social media platforms.

## Your Task

1. **Get post ID**: Ask for the post ID if not provided in $ARGUMENTS
2. **Get post details**: Use `get-post` tool to retrieve the post
3. **Show available platforms**: List all platforms this post targets
4. **Display previews**: For each platform or requested platform, show:
   - Platform name
   - Character count (if applicable)
   - Formatted content as it will appear
   - Hashtags (if included)
   - Image URLs (if applicable)
   - Platform-specific optimizations applied

5. **Offer comparisons**: Allow users to compare how content differs across platforms

## Platform-Specific Display

### Twitter
- Show character count (280 limit)
- Display thread indicators if content is split
- Show hashtag placement

### Instagram
- Show caption format
- List hashtags separately
- Display image requirements

### LinkedIn
- Show professional formatting
- Indicate article vs post format
- Display hashtag usage

### Facebook

- Indicate if link preview is included

### Threads

### Reddit

## Guidelines

- Use the MCP resource `preview://{postId}/{platform}` for platform-specific views
- Highlight platform-specific optimizations Thoth has applied
- Show character counts where relevant
- Indicate if content is truncated for any platform
- Suggest edits if content doesn't fit platform constraints
- Make it easy to view multiple platforms at once
