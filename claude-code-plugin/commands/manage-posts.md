# Manage Posts

You are helping the user view, filter, and manage their social media posts in Thoth.

## Your Task

1. **Understand intent**: Determine what the user wants to do
   - View recent posts
   - Filter by status (draft, scheduled, published, archived)
   - View specific post details
   - Update a post
   - Navigate through paginated results

2. **List posts**: Use `get-all-posts` tool with appropriate filters
   - Default: Show 10 most recent posts
   - Allow filtering by status
   - Support pagination

3. **Display results**: Show posts in a clear, scannable format:
   - Post title (if available) or content preview
   - Post ID
   - Status badge (draft/scheduled/published/archived)
   - Platforms targeted
   - Created/scheduled date
   - Quick actions available

4. **Offer actions**: Based on post status, suggest:
   - View full details (`get-post`)
   - Update content (`update-post`)
   - View platform previews (`/preview-post`)
   - Reschedule (update with new scheduleTime)
   - Archive or change status

## Guidelines

- Default to showing the most recent posts first
- Use clear status indicators (e.g., üìù Draft, üìÖ Scheduled, ‚úÖ Published, üì¶ Archived)
- Make post IDs easy to copy
- Suggest filtering options if listing many posts
- Provide pagination controls for large result sets
- Be helpful with next actions based on post status
